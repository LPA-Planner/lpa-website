      <h2>Planning Enforcement: Why LPA Planner?</h2>
      <p>Planning enforcement deals with issues such as unauthorised building works or changes of use. The process can feel complex and intimidating, with strict deadlines, technical terminology, and sometimes conflicting advice.</p>
      <p>With over a decade of experience working in Local Planning Authorities, LPA Planner brings that expertise directly to homeowners, architects, and developers, with years of experience:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Drafting, serving, and defending formal planning notices <span class="muted">including Enforcement Notices, Breach of Condition Notices, and Planning Contravention Notices.</span></li>
        <li>Leading successful prosecutions <span class="muted">for planning offences, acting as a professional witness and giving evidence in court.</span></li>
        <li>Assessing planning applications <span class="muted">ranging from householder extensions and Lawful Development Certificates to complex commercial schemes and major developments.</span></li>
        <li>Representing councils <span class="muted">at planning committees and public inquiries.</span></li>
        <li>Advising planning officers, councillors, and legal teams <span class="muted">on enforcement strategy and decision-making.</span></li>
      </ul>

      <p>LPA Planner was created to make planning advice clear, practical, and accessible, even for complex matters or enforcement investigations. Every service has clear, upfront fees and defined timeframes, so you know what to expect before work begins.</p>
