      <h2>Planning Enforcement and LPA Planner</h2>
      <p>Planning enforcement deals with issues such as unauthorised building works or changes of use. The process can feel complex and intimidating, with strict deadlines, technical terminology, and sometimes conflicting advice.</p>
      <p>With over a decade of experience working in Local Planning Authorities, LPA Planner brings that expertise directly to homeowners, architects, and developers, with years of experience:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Drafting, serving, and defending formal planning notices.</li>
        <li>Commanding successful planning prosecutions.</li>
        <li>Assessing varied and complex planning applications.</li>
        <li>Representing councils at committees and inquries.</li>
        <li>Advising planning officers, councillors, and legal teams on enforcement strategy.</li>
        <li>Responding to general queries received by Councils.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>LPA Planner was created to make clear, concise planning advice, even for complex matters or enforcement investigations. Every service has a clear scope of work and fees, with defined timeframes and formal written advice, so you know what to expect and when.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>Have questions about planning enforcement or how LPA Planner works? Here are clear answers to the most common questions people ask before starting a service.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>What is planning enforcement?</summary>
        <p><span class="muted">Planning enforcement is one of the three “pillars” of the planning system; along with "law and policies" and "applications and appeals".<br>It deals with breaches of planning control, such as unauthorised building works or changes of use. Enforcement addresses the harm caused by planning breaches, working for the benefit of both the developers (who may not realise the nuances of the planning system) and communities (who may be adversely impacted by planning breaches).</span></p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What is an LPA?</summary>
        <p><span class="muted">LPA stands for <em>Local Planning Authority</em>. This is usually your local council, responsible for deciding planning applications and investigating breaches. <em>LPA Planner</em> reflects over a decade of experience working inside LPAs, and now offers independent advice to help homeowners, agents, and businesses navigate the system with clarity.</span></p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why choose LPA Planner?</summary>
        <p><span class="muted">Unlike most planning agents, LPA Planner specialises in enforcement matters. The services and fees are clear, with upfront non-committal scope of works, and you’ll always get a written outcome (options letter, report, or document suite) with practical next steps. By comparison, many agents only focus on applications, with little transparency on fees or turnaround. LPA Planner fills that gap.</span></p>
      </details>

      <details>

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How quickly will I get a response?</summary>
        <p><span class="muted">LPA Planner reviews all submissions from the enquiry form, which are responded to within 2 working days. This is either an email rejection or a response with a scope of works and an invoice. Work begins once requested documents and payments have been submitted and cleared.<br>The response letter for the Quick Review service is issued within 2 working days after work begins.<br>The report for the Document Review service is issued within 5 working days after works begins.<br>The responses to the Appeal Submission service are aligned with statutory deadlines.<br>Urgent responses may be available for an additional fee.</span></p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you provide in-person services?</summary>
        <p><span class="muted">No. LPA Planner provides remote-only services, with advice delivered by email. Site specifics can usually be understood from documents, maps, and photos. Video calls can be arranged where needed.</span></p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What happens if I don’t pay, or I change my mind?</summary>
        <p><span class="muted">If you don’t pay, that will be treated as a cancellation of services, as explained in our <a href="/terms.html">Terms</a>. If you pay, and decide to cancel before receiving the documented outcome (letter, report, etc.) from your chosen service, you will be refunded in line with the Terms.</span></p>
