It is a statutory function of Local Planning Authorities, even if not widely publicised.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What is an LPA?</summary>

      <details>
        <summary>What if I change my mind?</summary>
        <p>You can change your mind at any time. <br> If you submit an enquiry and decide not to proceed before payment, you don’t need to do anything further. <br> If you cancel after payment, you’ll be refunded in line with the Terms. <br> If you cancel after work has begun, you’ll still receive a refund, but deductions may be made for the time spent by LPA Planner preparing your response. <br> The Terms set out the full cancellation policy.</p>
