      <h1>Privacy & Data Protection Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated: 6 September 2025</strong></p>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>LPA Planner is committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information responsibly. This policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and your rights under the UK General Data Protection Regulations (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 [as amended]. LPA Planner (the Data Controller, a sole trader based in England) is registered with the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) with the reference C1767117.</p>

      <h2>2. Data That Is Collected</h2>
      <p>I only collect the minimum amount of data and information necessary to fulfil the obligation to provide services. For enquiries, that includes names, email addresses, and the location / address of the site. For services, this includes planning documents, additional site information, or other data you choose to share for the purpose of providing advice.</p>

      <h2>2a. Special Category Data</h2>
<p>In some cases, providing planning advice may involve special category data (for example, details relating to a place of worship or medical facility). Where this is relevant, the lawful basis for the service is “contract”, and the additional GDPR Article 9 conditions relied on are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explicit consent – where you choose to provide such data; or </li>
        <li>Legal claims – where the data is necessary to prepare, pursue, or defend planning matters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All such data is treated as confidential, access is restricted, and it is deleted when no longer needed.</p>
      
      <h2>3. How I Use Your Data</h2>
     <p>I only collect information and data for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To respond to your enquiries and provide planning advice.</li>
        <li>To maintain basic records for administration and legal compliance.</li>
        <li>To improve the services I offer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
     <p> The legal basis for the data processing is below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Responding to enquiries – Legitimate interests</li>
        <li>Providing planning advice/services – Contract</li>
        <li>Record-keeping and compliance – Legal obligations</li>
        <li>Improving services – Legitimate interests</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Sharing Your Data</h2>
      <p>I do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes. I use trusted providers to run the site and forms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Microsoft (Microsoft 365 services) – provides email, enquiry forms, and may store client documents (e.g. OneDrive).</li>
        <li>Cloudflare – hosts and protects this website and email traffic.</li>
        <li>Monzo Bank – processes payments for services.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They process data on my instructions, and only for the purposes stated in this policy. I may also share data if the law requires it.</p>
      <p>This site (<a href="https://lpaplanner.co.uk">LPAplanner.co.uk</a>) uses essential cookies set by Cloudflare to ensure security and performance. These cookies are strictly necessary and cannot be turned off.</p>

      <h2>6. Data Storage & Security</h2>
      <p>I take reasonable steps to protect your data from loss, misuse, or unauthorised access.</p>
      <p>Your information is stored securely and only kept for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose it was collected for. Enquiries are kept for 6 months and client files are kept for 6 years (to meet legal / insurance purposes), after which time they are deleted.</p>
      <p>Any sensitive information (such as special category data) is treated as confidential, access is limited, and they’re deleted when no longer needed for your matter.</p>
      <p>Some of our service providers may transfer personal data outside the UK. Where this happens, they use legal safeguards approved under UK GDPR (such as Standard Contractual Clauses with the UK Addendum).</p>
 
      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Under UK GDPR you have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request a copy of the data I hold about you.</li>
        <li>Ask for incorrect data to be corrected.</li>
        <li>Request that your data is deleted where legally possible.</li>
        <li>Restrict how your data is used in certain circumstances.</li>
        <li>Ask for your data in a portable format to move it to another provider.</li>
        <li>Object to processing based on legitimate interests.</li>
        <li>Withdraw your consent where processing is based on it (for example, if you have chosen to provide special category data).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise your rights, contact me using the details below. Complaints can also be made to the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/">ICO</a> directly.</p>
