      <div class="card" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>LPA Planner (a protected trading name) provides independent town planning advice and support, specialising in enforcement matters, planning refusals, and appeal submissions.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
        <p>LPA Planner does not provide in-person services, and any service provided is advisory only. LPA Planner provides guidance and recommendations based on the information you provide and relevant legislation, caselaw, and planning policy. LPA Planner does not guarantee a particular outcome from the advice provided or any submissions made on your behalf. LPA Planner does not provide legal advice, including advice on criminal matters such as planning offences.</p>
        <p>LPA Planner checks all enquiries before confirming work. Any work that is accepted by LPA Planner will have a LPA Planner reference number (starting with "LPA"), Invoice Number, and scope of work. The scope of work will be confirmed in writing, typically within the email accompanying your invoice. Any relevant documents will be requested at that time. Payment of the invoice constitutes acceptance of both the defined scope of work and the terms of the invoice.</p>
        <p>The day on which the requested documents and payments have been submitted and cleared is considered the date on which <strong>"work begins"</strong>. You will receive your documented outcome (such as a letter, report, or document suite) within the advertised timeframes, starting from the date on which work begins.</p>
        <p>Any work that is not agreed and paid for by the Invoice Deadline will be considered a cancellation of services.</p>

        <h2>3. Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information to enable LPA Planner to give reliable advice. LPA Planner is not responsible for any delays or additional costs arising from inaccurate, incomplete, or late information provided by you.</p>

        <h2>4. Fees & Payment</h2>
        <p>The fees are stated on the <a href="/services.html">Services & Pricing</a> page, and all payments must be made against an issued invoice. LPA Planner accepts payments by bank transfer, or by Apple Pay / card via PayPal, as explained on every invoice. Payments sent without an invoice will not be treated as acceptance of works (see Section 5).</p>
        <p>Fees for the "Quick Review" and "Document Review" services are due before work begins. Fees for the "Appeal Submission" service are dependent on the complexity and scale of the case, and are separated into two installments; with the first installment required before work begins. For all services, the fees will be clearly explained before any work begins.</p>
        <p>The fees are reviewed every six months, and any amended fees will apply to new enquiries and instructions agreed after the review date.</p>
        <p>An Urgent Review charge may be applied where next-day advice or work is requested. Urgent Review services are offered at LPA Planner’s discretion and availability is not guaranteed. The scope of such work, and any additional fee, will be confirmed in writing before work begins, either in the invoice or scope of work, or separately via email.</p>

        <h2>5. Cancellations & Refunds</h2>
        <p>Any enquiries that are not accepted will not be given an LPA Reference Number, and no invoice will be issued. Where payment has been sent without an invoice, it does not mean the work has been accepted, and any such payments may be returned (minus any bank charges or admin costs). If the sender cannot be identified, a refund cannot be guaranteed.</p>
          <p>You may cancel any service at any time in writing by email. If you cancel your service before work begins, you will receive a refund (minus any bank charges or admin costs). If you cancel your service after work begins, fees will be charged proportionate to work completed at the point of cancellation (including admin time and third party costs).</p>
        <p>Any cancellation of services (including non-payment of services by the Invoice Deadline) will require a new enquiry, LPA Reference Number, scope of work, and invoice. This results in new timeframes, including enquiry response times, invoice deadlines, and delivery deadlines for documented outcomes.</p>

        <h2>6. Liability</h2>
        <p>LPA Planner’s professional indemnity insurance provides cover up to £250,000 for claims arising from professional negligence. LPA Planner’s total liability to you will not exceed this amount in aggregate, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p>LPA Planner is not liable for any indirect or consequential losses, including those arising from delays in payment clearance, document submission, scope agreement, or missed statutory deadlines.</p>
        <p>LPA Planner is not responsible for delays or failures caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including IT or communication failures, illness, or changes in legislation or planning policy.</p>
        <p>Any written advice (letters, reports or otherwise) from LPA Planner is for the named client only, and must not be copied, distributed, or relied upon by any other party without written consent from LPA Planner. LPA Planner accepts no responsibility for unauthorised use.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Data Protection</h2>
        <p>LPA Planner handles personal data in accordance with the <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales, and any disputes shall be handled by the relevant authority in England and Wales.</p>
