        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>LPA Planner provides independent town planning advice and support, specialising in enforcement matters, refusals, and appeal submissions.</p>

        <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>

LPA Planner does not provide legal advice, including advice on criminal matters such as planning offences.</p>
        <p>The scope of works will be confirmed in writing, typically within the email accompanying your invoice. Payment of the invoice constitutes acceptance of both the defined scope of works and the terms of the invoice.</p>
        <p>Any work that is not agreed and paid for by the Invoice Deadline will be considered a cancellation of servcies.</p>

        <h2>3. Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information to enable LPA Planner to give reliable advice. LPA Planner is not responsible for any delays or additional costs arising from inaccurate, incomplete, or late information provided by you.</p>

        <p>The fees are stated on the <a href="/services.html">Services & Pricing</a> page, and are agreed in writing before work begins. LPA Planner accepts payments by bank transfer only, as explained on every invoice.</p>
        <p>Fees for the "Quick Review" and "Document Review" services are due before works begins. Fees for the "Appeal Submission" service are dependent on the complexity and scale of the case, and is separated into two installments; with the first installment required before work begins. For all servcies, the fees will be clearly explained before any work begins.</p>
        <p>The Fees are reviewed every six months, and any amended fees will apply to new enquiries and instructions agreed after the review date.</p>
        <p>An Urgent Review charge may be applied where next-day advice or work is requested. Whether this service is available will be at the discretion of LPA Planner. The scope of such work, and any additional fee, will be confirmed in writing before work begins.</p>

        <h2>5. Cancellations & Refunds</h2>
        <p>You may cancel work before it begins for a full refund of any deposit that is paid and cleared. Once work begins, fees will be charged proportionate to work completed at the point of cancellation (including admin time and third party costs).</p>
        <p>Any cancellation of services (including non-payment of servcies by the Invoice Deadline) will require a new enquiry, LPA Reference Number, scope of work, and invoice. This results in new timefrmaes for any enquriy response or servcies.</p>
